# LAPD Task  ‚Äì SSD Forensic Triage (Redacted)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a redacted case study based on a real incident. All identifying details have been removed. This write-up is for educational and professional development purposes only.

---

## Objective

To investigate a Windows-based SSD obtained from a department machine suspected of unauthorized software installation or suspicious behavior. The goal is to:
- Preserve the original evidence
- Extract key forensic artifacts
- Build a timeline of relevant activity
- Apply the NIST 800-61 incident response model to the process

## Nigel's Environment Setup

| Element        | Value |
|----------------|-------|
| Host Machine   | Intel MacBook Pro (2019) |
| Forensic OS    | Kali Linux (running in VM) |
| Adapter Used   | USB-C to SATA |
| Access Mode    | Read-only (`mount -o ro`) |
| SSD Type       | [REDACTED] |

---

## Artifact Targets to examine

- [ ] Event logs (`.evtx` files)
- [ ] Prefetch files
- [ ] Browser history database (Chrome SQLite)
- [ ] Downloads folder
- [ ] Program Files folders
- [ ] File metadata (timestamps, last accessed)

---

## Tools To Be Used

| Tool            | Purpose |
|------------------|---------|
| `evtx_dump.py`   | Parse Windows Event Logs |
| `WinPrefetchView`| Analyze Prefetch files |
| `sqlitebrowser`  | View browser history database |
| `stat`/`ls`      | View file metadata and timestamps |
| Bash scripting   | Automate evidence extraction |

## Next Step: Build Timeline

Will begin mapping out a timeline using:
- **Event ID 11707** ‚Äì Software installed
- **Event ID 4624** ‚Äì Logon events
- **Event ID 4688** ‚Äì Process execution
- **Chrome visit timestamps** ‚Äì User browsing activity

Timeline analysis will follow NIST SP 800-61 response phases:
1. Preparation  
2. Detection & Analysis  
3. Containment, Eradication, Recovery  
4. Post-Incident Activity

## üìå Notes
All actions taken will be documented in `notes/` as a log. No actions will alter the original evidence source.
