# 🧠 Windows SSD Forensic Triage – LAPD Internship Case Study

> 🔍 A hands-on digital forensic investigation conducted during my internship with the Los Angeles Police Department's IT Division.

## 🗂️ Case Summary

This project involves the forensic analysis of a suspected malware-infected HP Windows SSD device. The investigation was initiated after multiple reports of system instability and a blue screen crash, with internal endpoint protection tools like SentinelOne raising alerts. My task was to collect data safely from the drive using a write blocker, review system logs, and identify any indicators of compromise.

The investigation followed key steps outlined by NIST SP 800-86 and 800-61, focusing on secure handling, triage, and documentation.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- 🔹 SentinelOne (EDR)
- 🔹 Malwarebytes
- 🔹 Windows Event Viewer
- 🔹 VirusTotal
- 🔹 Wireshark
- 🔹 macOS with write-blocked SSD access

## 🔍 Investigation Goals

- ✅ Identify possible infection sources
- ✅ Check for persistence mechanisms
- ✅ Examine system logs for anomalies
- ✅ Redact sensitive information
- ✅ Deliver a final report suitable for public viewing
